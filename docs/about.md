        <legend>Who am I?</legend>
            <span><img class="nofloat670" src="/assets/images/walking_full.jpg">I was born in Australia, but moved to Maine when I was 14 to be closer to my mother's family. I graduated from Presque Isle High School and then the University of Maine with a bachelors degree in economics.<br><br>In 2012, I began teaching math and computer science at Sacopee Valley High School and in 2016 my wife and I bought a home in the district. I am proud to call Hiram home. I consider myself a lifelong learner and try to instill that mentality in the students I am lucky enough to teach. This whole school year (2019/20), in the evenings after school, but before beginning this campaign in earnest, I've traveled into Portland twice a week to study statistics and probability and how they relate to the calculus class that I teach, and also to expand my mathematical skill set.<br><br>Within the Sacopee Valley school system, I chair the math department and lead the junior class trip to Quebec in early march. I'm the vice president of the Tri-County teachers union and am the statistician for our contract negotiations team. Outside of the school district, I'm on the Hiram Conservation Committee and a member of the Porter Grange #569.<br><br>I met my wife working at a summer camp outside Augusta and we got married in 2016. It was a perfect late summer day at Maple Rock Farm in Parsonsfield. Outside of work, we enjoy camping, kayaking, the Ossipee Valley Music Festival and our two cats and I personally enjoy cooking, reading, brewing all-grain beer with my brother and splitting wood. On our two acres in Hiram, I've even planted a little vineyard!<br><br>These are the things I'm most passionate about. Beyond that, I'm ready to learn. Over the next months, leading up to June 9th and November 3rd, I look forward to meeting the residents of district 70 and getting to know the place I want to represent. If there is an issue near to your heart, please reach out and request a meeting. I hope to find myself at your door soon!</span>
