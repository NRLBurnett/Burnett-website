        <legend>Who am I?</legend>
            <span><img class="nofloat670" src="/assets/images/walking_full.jpg">I was born in Australia, and moved to Maine when I was 14 to be closer to my mother's family. I graduated from Presque Isle High School and then the University of Maine with a bachelor's degree in economics.
<br><br>
In 2012, I began teaching math and computer science at Sacopee Valley High School and in 2016 my wife and I bought a home in the district. I am proud to call Hiram home. I consider myself a lifelong learner and try to instill that mentality in the students I am lucky enough to teach. This whole school year (2021/22), in the evenings after school, but before beginning this campaign in earnest, I've traveled into Portland twice a week to study number and graph theory and how they extend the math classes that I teach, and also to expand my mathematical skill set. I’m 3 classes away from finishing the pure mathematics undergrad curriculum!
<br><br>
Within the Sacopee Valley school system, I chair the math department and lead the junior class trip to Quebec in early March. I'm the vice president of the Tri-County Teachers Association and am the statistician for our contract negotiations team. Outside of the school district, I'm elected to the Hiram Conservation Committee, a board of the Francis Small Heritage Trust,  and the treasurer of Porter Grange #569.
<br><br>
I met my wife working at a summer camp outside Augusta and we got married in 2016. It was a perfect late summer day at Maple Rock Farm in Parsonsfield. Outside of work, we enjoy camping, kayaking, the Ossipee Valley Music Festival and our two cats and I personally enjoy cooking, reading, brewing all-grain beer with my brother and splitting wood. On our two acres in Hiram, I'm even cultivating  a little vineyard! Hopefully the birds are nicer to me this year. Last year, I was only able to make 3 little pots of delicious jelly from my 14 vines!
<br><br>
These are the things that make me me. I hope that demonstrates that I'm ready to learn. Over the next months leading up to November 8th, I look forward to meeting the residents of district 82 and getting to know more about the place I’m working to represent. If there is an issue near to your heart, please reach out and request a meeting. 
<br><br>
As of the end of July, I’ve knocked on over 1200 doors. I have another 1600 still to visit. I hope to find myself at your door soon!</span>
